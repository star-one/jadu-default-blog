# jadu-default-blog
Default Jadu html and css template files for Birmingham City Council blogs

To use, go to Template -> Choose a Template and select Custom; then go to Custom Template and copy and paste
the .css code into the box, then go to Template Includes and copy and paste the HTML into each section in turn.

default-blog.css shows the metadata about when a post was published and who by, whilst newsroom-blog.css hides
that metadata meaning the post author will need to add that manually, which was a requirement for the newsroom
version.
